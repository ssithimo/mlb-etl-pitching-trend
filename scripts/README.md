To run weekly updates, downloand the pyscript and copy the launchd plist script onto your MacOS terminal.

For the plist script. make sure to change the YOUR_USERNAME and PATH_TO_PYSCRIPT with your actual macOS username and full path to your pyscript file

The launchd plist script will:

- Pull pitch data from the past week

- Append it to your PostgreSQL database (if DATABASE_URL is correctly set in your .env)

- Append info to your etl_output.log and etl_dates.log

- The logs will accumulate each day â€” not be overwritten
